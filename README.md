# Protein Sequence Analysis on COVID-19 Dataset

### ➡️ The repository consists of Code & Datasets used for the Protein Sequence Analysis

### ⚫️ Project Insights

1️⃣ The project consists of analysis done on COVID datasets for understanding the Amino Acids Sequence

2️⃣ The datasets is extracted from Gen Bank for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

3️⃣ Protein Synthesis is as follow DNA -> mRNA -> Protein/AA

4️⃣ The data id is MT772240.1 

5️⃣ Futher the visualization is done using nglview 

6️⃣ 3-D strucutre is created for the sequence of Amino Acids
